# Web Scrapers Collection

This repository is a collection of various web scrapers I built while learning Python. The scrapers are divided into individual directories based on the type of data they collect or the site they scrape.

### Directory List:
- **CBSE Results**: Scrapes exam results from the CBSE results website
- **Cricket Scraper**: (Used to) Fetches live scores and cricket match data. [It's dead now]
- **Data Collection**: General-purpose data scrapers for different websites.
- **GitHubAutomation**: Automates repo uploads on GitHub.
- **Increasing traffic**: A basic scraper with the goal of increasing traffic [juse barely] on your website.
- **Instagram**: Scrapes data from Instagram profiles.
- **Job Search**: Collects job postings from various job search platforms.
- **Picture Of The Day**: Fetches daily images from a specific sites like NASA.
- **Reddit Scraper**: Scrapes various data from Reddit.
- **Scrape all the**: A generalized scraper for gathering all sorts of data.

Each project here serves as a learning experience and is fairly simple. Feel free to explore the code or tweak it to fit your own use cases
